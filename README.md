# push_swap

push_swap is a C project that involves implementing an efficient sorting algorithm using a limited set of operations. The challenge is to sort a list of integers into ascending order using the fewest number of operations possible. The allowed operations typically include push, swap, and rotate, each of which can be applied to two stacks.

Key features of push_swap:

Sorts a list of integers using a stack-based approach.
Implements a variety of operations like sa (swap), pa (push), ra (rotate), etc.
Focuses on efficiency, aiming to sort the list with the minimum number of operations.
Requires analyzing and optimizing sorting algorithms tailored to stack manipulation.
The project provides insight into algorithm optimization, stack data structures, and problem-solving techniques in C. It helps develop skills in sorting algorithms and computational complexity, requiring creativity to minimize the number of operations while achieving a sorted list.
